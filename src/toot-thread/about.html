    Enter the url of a toot and press Submit, and the app will progressively walk back through the thread to find the parent until there are no more.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can append a toot parameter with a url encoding to pre-fill the form. This will look a bit like this:
  </p>
  <code>
    <a href="?toot=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.me.uk%2F%40garius%2F110340128553620052">...?toot=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.me.uk%2F%40garius%2F110340128553620052</a>
  </code>
  <p>
    Caveats:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When you submit the form, the window is updated. You can then bookmark or share that link.
    </li>
    <li>
      This only works on public toots.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is a delay in fetching the parent toot.
    </li>
  </ul>
